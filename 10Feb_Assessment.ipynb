    "\n",
    "#### 'w' (Write Only) - This mode is used to write to a file. If the file already exists, its content is truncated, meaning that all previous data is deleted. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'a' (Append Only) - This mode is used to add data to an existing file. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file, so new data will be added to the end of the existing data. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'x' (Exclusive Creation) - This mode is used to create a new file, but only if it does not already exist. If the file already exists, it will raise a FileExistsError.\n",

    "#### 't' (Text Mode) - This mode is used to open a text file, such as a .txt or .py file. It is the default mode and can be combined with other modes, such as 'rt' (read text) or 'wt' (write text)."
